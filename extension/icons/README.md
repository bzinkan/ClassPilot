# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

For now, you can use placeholder icons or generate icons using any icon generator.

Recommended icon design:
- A monitor/screen icon with a small graduation cap or book overlay
- Blue color scheme matching the extension theme (#3b82f6)
- Simple, clear design that works at small sizes

You can use tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Figma/Canva for custom designs
- Or any icon library with educational/monitoring themes
