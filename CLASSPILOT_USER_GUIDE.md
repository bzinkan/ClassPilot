---

## Data & Privacy

### Privacy-First Design

ClassPilot is built with privacy as a core principle:

✅ **Transparent Monitoring**
- Students see disclosure banner when extension is active
- Clear notification that monitoring is occurring
- No hidden or secret tracking

✅ **Authorized Live View**
- Live View starts only from an authorized teacher request for the current student session
- The stream is temporary, encrypted in transit, and is not recorded by the extension or SchoolPilot servers
- An authorized teacher can explicitly save a local still image or recording from the dashboard; the school controls that downloaded copy
- Chrome may show a screen picker on unmanaged devices; managed Chrome policy can permit capture without one
- The extension displays the applicable monitoring or sharing indicator

✅ **Purpose-Limited Data Processing**
- Processes school-issued identifiers, active-tab URLs/titles, heartbeat state, and classroom communications needed for the service
- May process tracking-window thumbnails about every 5 seconds only while an authorized teacher or administrator has the exact class view visible, and about every 30 seconds otherwise while school-managed monitoring remains active; SchoolPilot retains class-bound images and discards gap/student-session pixels
- May process an exact-bound safety screenshot under the configured school policy
- Does not intentionally collect keystrokes, typed passwords, microphone audio, camera video, incognito-window activity, or browsing from unmanaged profiles
- The school setting controls heartbeat history and related report detail; ambient thumbnails, safety evidence, communications, account/audit records, and local teacher downloads follow separate policies

✅ **School Privacy Controls**
- Designed to support schools' FERPA, COPPA, and local-policy responsibilities
- Clear disclosure of the data the service processes
- School-admin authorization, retention, and access controls
- Schools remain responsible for required parent/student notices and consent decisions

### Data Retention

**Configurable Activity-History Retention:**

Access via **Settings → Data Retention**

**Options:**
- Any whole number from 1 through 365 days
- Default: 30 days

**Automatic Cleanup:**
- The scheduled job checks hourly, near 30 minutes past the hour
- Heartbeat history and related session-report detail older than the selected period are purged or redacted
- Ambient thumbnails use a separate 60–120-second operational cache
- Exact safety/evidence image content uses a separate deployment retention policy (default 30 days); bounded review metadata may remain
- Account, audit, and teacher-downloaded files follow their separate documented or contractual policies

**Export Before Deletion:**
1. Go to Data Retention settings
2. Click "Export Data"
3. Select date range
4. Download CSV (.csv) file
5. Contains the exportable records returned for the selected range; verify the
   file before relying on it as a complete legal or archival export

### What Data is Collected

**Per Activity Event (every 10 seconds):**
- Student ID
- Device ID
- Tab title
- URL visited
- Timestamp
- Favicon URL

**Session Data:**
- Login time
- Logout time
- Total session duration
- Device information

**Not directly collected through page or account APIs:**
- Keystrokes or form inputs
- Passwords or credentials
- Camera or microphone content
- Downloaded files

Authorized class-bound tracking-window thumbnails, exact-tab safety screenshots, and temporary
Live View can show the website content visibly rendered on the shared tab or
screen. That visible content can include a message, email, or file if it is open
at the time. Live View streams are not recorded by the extension or SchoolPilot
servers; an authorized teacher can explicitly save a local recording or still
image, which the school controls. Captured images and ClassPilot communications
follow their separate documented access and retention controls.

### IP Allowlist (Optional)

Restrict dashboard access to specific IP addresses:

**Enable IP Allowlist:**
1. Admin panel → Security Settings
2. Enable "IP Allowlist"
3. Add allowed IP addresses (e.g., school network)
4. Save

**Effect:**
- Only connections from allowed IPs can access dashboard
- Blocks unauthorized access from outside school network
- Additional security layer

---

## Admin Features

Access via **Admin Panel** (admin accounts only)

### Teacher Account Management

**Create Teacher Account:**
1. Click "Add Teacher"
2. Enter teacher information:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Username
   - Temporary password
3. Assign role (Teacher or Admin)

---

## Chrome Extension

### How It Works

The ClassPilot Chrome Extension runs silently in the background on student Chromebooks.

**Architecture:**
- **Manifest V3** - Modern, secure extension format
- **Service Worker** - Persistent background process
- **Content Scripts** - Inject into web pages for activity tracking
- **Offscreen Document** - WebRTC screen sharing handler

### Automatic Student Detection

**Google Workspace Integration:**
1. Extension uses Chrome Identity API
2. Detects student's Google Workspace email
3. Automatically registers device with email
4. No manual configuration needed

**What Students See:**
- Extension icon in toolbar (can be hidden by admin)
- Disclosure banner: "This device is being monitored"
- Screen share picker (on unmanaged devices only)

### Heartbeat System

The extension sends activity updates every **10 seconds**:

**What's Sent:**
- Current tab title
- Current URL
- Timestamp
- Student identifier
- Device identifier

**Reliability Features:**
- `chrome.alarms` API for persistent heartbeats
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Survives service worker sleep/wake cycles
- Network failure handling

### Activity Tracking

**Tab Navigation:**
- Detects when student switches tabs
- Tracks active tab changes
- Records navigation events

**Camera Detection:**
- Non-intrusive API wrapper
- Detects `getUserMedia()` calls
- No access to camera content
- Only knows camera is active/inactive

**Browsing Activity:**
- Uses `chrome.webNavigation` API
- Tracks page loads and navigations
- Records URL visits
- Captures page titles

### WebRTC Screen Sharing

**Two Capture Modes:**

**1. Silent Tab Capture** (Managed Chromebooks)
- Uses `chrome.tabCapture` API
- No student prompt required
- Requires Google Admin policy: "Allow tab capture"
- Instant streaming to teacher

**2. Screen Picker** (Fallback)
- Uses `getDisplayMedia()` API
- Student sees picker dialog
- Must select screen/window/tab
- Can deny request

**Connection Process:**
1. Teacher clicks "Watch Screen"
2. Extension receives request via WebSocket
3. Creates offscreen document for WebRTC
4. Attempts silent capture (if managed)
5. Falls back to picker if silent fails
6. Establishes peer connection to teacher
7. Streams video in real-time

**Network:**
- Uses authorized, short-lived STUN/TURN/TURNS configuration for NAT traversal
- Prefers a direct WebRTC path and relays through SchoolPilot TURN when needed
- Low latency (~1-2 seconds)
- Adaptive bitrate

### Installation

**For IT Administrators:**

1. **Use the reviewed Chrome Web Store release:**
   - Confirm the live listing version and the retained release SHA-256
   - For 2.7.1, the publisher uploads only the verified
     `dist/ClassPilot-v2.7.1.zip` built by the repository release pipeline from
     a clean tagged commit; school IT must not assemble or sideload a production
     `.zip` or `.crx`

2. **Google Admin Console:**
   - Navigate to Devices → Chrome → Apps & Extensions
   - Click "Add app or extension"
   - Add the official ClassPilot Chrome Web Store listing by extension ID
   - Set install policy to "Force install"
   - Apply to student organizational units

3. **Configure Policies:**
   - Enable silent tab capture policy (optional)
   - Set extension settings via managed storage
   - Configure server URL

4. **Deploy:**
   - Push to student Chromebooks
   - Extension auto-installs on next Chrome sync
   - Students do not need to take action

**Manual Installation (Development/Testing):**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select extension folder
5. Extension activates immediately

Manual unpacked installation is only for an isolated development device. It is
not a production deployment or a substitute for the managed test-OU gate.

### Troubleshooting Extension

**Extension Not Appearing:**
- Check Chrome sync is enabled
- Verify student is signed in with Google Workspace account
- Check Google Admin force-install policy is applied
- Wait 5-10 minutes for policy propagation

**Heartbeats Not Sending:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify server URL is correct
- Check browser console for errors (`chrome://extensions` → Details → Inspect views → service worker)
- Reload extension

**Silent Capture Not Working:**
- Verify Google Admin policy "Allow tab capture" is enabled
- Check device is enrolled in Google Admin
- End the failed Live View negotiation and start a new exact-session request;
  do not treat a managed-device capture failure as authorization to reuse stale
  signaling or another student's stream

**Screen Share Picker Not Appearing:**
- Browser may have blocked popup
- Check notification permissions
- Verify extension has screen capture permissions

---

## Troubleshooting
