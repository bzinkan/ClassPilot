Exactly ✅ — that’s the right direction, and it keeps your admin workflow simple while still making ClassPilot scalable.

Here’s how you can think about it — same foundation you have now, just adding one clean middle layer so admin can go from “students by grade” → “classes within that grade” → “teachers for those classes.”

🧭 1. Keep Grade as Your Starting Point

Grades remain your top-level buckets in the Admin dashboard.
This is perfect because:

It’s intuitive for admins (“show me all 7th graders”).

It works even if a student isn’t in a class yet.

It keeps new-student onboarding familiar.

So you keep your current workflow:

Extension → Admin assigns Grade → Student appears in Grade list.

That’s still step one. 👍

🧩 2. Add a “Classes Within Grade” Layer

Once the admin clicks a grade (say “7th Grade”), they see all students plus a side panel for class creation:

Example:

7th Grade
 ├── 7th Science P3 (Teacher: Ellis)
 ├── 7th ELA P4 (Teacher: Mason)
 ├── 7th Math P2 (Teacher: Hughes)


Each class (or group) belongs to a grade and a teacher.
So instead of filtering by grade only, you’re filtering by grade → then class.

Admin can:

Create a class within that grade

Select multiple students from the grade roster

Assign them (and a teacher) to that class

Repeat for each subject or period

🧑‍🏫 3. Assign Teachers to Classes (Not Grades)

This is key.

Teachers don’t “own” the entire grade — they own one or more classes inside it.

This also solves the “students have multiple teachers” issue.

For example:

Teacher	Classes they see
Mrs. Ellis	7th Science P3, 7th Science P5
Mr. Hughes	7th Math P2
Mrs. Mason	7th ELA P4
Mr. Rivera	8th Social Studies P3

That’s exactly how GoGuardian and Securly manage class-level visibility.

🧰 4. How Admin Workflow Feels (Visually)

Picture it like this:

Admin Dashboard

📚 Grades
   > Grade 5
   > Grade 6
   > Grade 7  ← click
   > Grade 8


Inside “Grade 7” View

[ Add New Class ]
------------------------------------------------
Existing Classes:
• 7th Science P3 (Ellis)
• 7th Math P2 (Hughes)
• 7th ELA P4 (Mason)
------------------------------------------------
Unassigned Students:
[ ] Ava M.
[ ] Logan R.
[ ] Noah S.
[Assign Selected to Class ⏷]


Admin selects a few students and assigns them to a class/teacher.
If the class doesn’t exist yet, they can click “Add New Class” right there.

🧠 5. Permissions and Filtering Automatically Follow

Once a class is created and linked to a teacher:

That teacher’s dashboard now shows that class as an available group/session.

The teacher can click “Start Class” to begin a live session (Option 2 model).

The teacher sees only those students — no one outside their assigned classes.

Admins still see everything by grade, but teachers’ visibility becomes automatically scoped.

🔒 6. Keeps Everything Simple for Admins

Grades still function as the main organizational tool.

You don’t force admins to deal with complex group logic — it’s just “classes under a grade.”

Admins can reassign teachers or move students between classes easily.

Teachers don’t have to create groups unless they want to make custom ones (“Robotics Club,” “After-School Study”).

✅ TL;DR

Your improved flow:

Extension adds student → Admin assigns grade ✅

Admin clicks that grade → creates classes within it

Assigns students + teacher to each class

Teachers see only their assigned classes (can start/end sessions)

Admin can still view by grade for big-picture oversight
