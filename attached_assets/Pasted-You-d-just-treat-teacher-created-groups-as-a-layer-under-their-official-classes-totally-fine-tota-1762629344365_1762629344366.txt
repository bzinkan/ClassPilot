You’d just treat teacher-created groups as a layer under their official classes — totally fine, totally safe, and very useful in real classrooms.

Here’s how it fits into your structure cleanly:

🧩 1. Two Types of Groups (Clear and Simple)
Group Type	Created By	Purpose	Visibility
Admin Class (Roster Group)	Admin	Official class roster, used for attendance, session access, and admin reporting	Teacher + Admin
Teacher Small Group	Teacher	Temporary or subject-specific subgroup for their own students	Only visible to that teacher (and Admin for auditing)
🧑‍🏫 2. What Teachers Can Do

Inside their dashboard, a teacher sees their official classes (set by Admin):

My Classes
 ├── 7th Science P3
 ├── 7th Science P5


Under each class, they can:

Click “Add Small Group”

Select students only from that class (already assigned to them)

Name the group (“Lab Partners,” “Needs Support,” “Advanced Group”)

Start a session or view data filtered to that group

💡 Key rule: Teachers can only group students they’re already assigned.
They can’t pull students from another teacher’s class or grade.

🔒 3. Permissions Logic (super easy)

Every teacher group inherits visibility from the teacher’s assigned class list.

The system checks:

“Is this student already assigned to the current teacher?”
✅ Yes → can be added to a small group
❌ No → cannot appear in their small group selector

Admins always see all groups for auditing, but only the teacher who created them can manage them.

⚙️ 4. What This Unlocks for Teachers

Flexible instruction: breakout groups, interventions, advanced learners, project teams

Targeted monitoring: watch only that small group live during class

Custom reports: see history or engagement for that subgroup

Session convenience: quick “Start Small Group Session” button for mini-sessions

🧭 5. Admin Experience

Admins still manage only the official classes.
They don’t need to track or edit teacher-made small groups — those are ephemeral, like “Scenes” or “Collections” in GoGuardian.
Admins can view them in an audit view if needed (“show all groups created by Mrs. Ellis”), but it’s hands-off by default.

🧱 6. System Snapshot
Grade 7
 ├── Class: 7th Science P3 (Admin Created)
 │     ├── Small Group: Lab Group A (Teacher Created)
 │     ├── Small Group: Advanced Learners (Teacher Created)
 │     └── Small Group: Homework Help (Teacher Created)
 ├── Class: 7th Math P2
 │     └── Small Group: Algebra Help

✅ TL;DR

Yes, teachers should absolutely be able to make small groups.

They can only use students they’re already assigned.

Admin doesn’t have to touch these.

The structure stays clean, scalable, and secure.
