I see the issue now. Let me check the tile structure to understand why there's still blank space:

Decided on useEffect cleanup logic (22 seconds)
I see the issue! The problem is in the conditional rendering logic. When liveStream becomes falsy, React should automatically switch to showing the tab info, but our cleanup effect might be interfering. Let me simplify it:


Edited client/src/components/student-tile.tsx

Decided on stream cleanup logic (9 seconds)
Actually, I see the real issue now - when the stream stops, the video might still be in the portal if it was expanded! Let me add cleanup for that:


Edited client/src/components/student-tile.tsx

Decided on stream rendering logic (9 seconds)
Let me restart the app to test the fix:


Restarted Start application

Decided on state update detection approach (14 seconds)
Now let me check if the issue is with how the liveStreams state is being passed to the tiles:


Executed rg -B 3 -A 1 -n liveStream= client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx

"Decided on state update mechanism" (4 seconds)
Let me check the logs to see what's happening when you stop live view:

Checked console and system logs

Re-examined JSX structure for rendering (10 seconds)
Looking at the screenshot again, I can see the tab info IS showing (URL and time), but there's a large blank space above it. This suggests the video container div might still be rendering even though liveStream should be null. Let me add console logging to debug this:

Decided on state update debugging approach (8 seconds)
Now please test again and check the browser console (F12 → Console tab). When you:

Start live view
Stop live view
See the blank space
Look for log messages like [StudentTile device-xxx] liveStream: true/false. This will tell us if the component is receiving the correct liveStream value.

Also, can you take a screenshot of the entire browser window including the console at the bottom when you see the blank space? This will help me diagnose if it's a state issue or a rendering issue.
